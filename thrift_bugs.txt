A couple of bugs in thrift:

Erlang lib 
----------
- doesn't increment seqid (thrift_client.erl).
- one-way function calls are sent with the CALL message type instead of ONEWAY (thrift_client.erl).

Javascript generated
--------------------
- Exceptions need an extra "beginstruct, beginfield" around them.
- Exceptions: no way to tell what fieldid they should have!
- Generated server does not inherit as it should (must be fixed explicitly).
